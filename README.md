#JetBrains Xodus
JetBrains Xodus is pure Java transactional schemaless embedded database. Initially, it was developed for
[JetBrains YouTrack](http://jetbrains.com/youtrack) bug and issue tracker; at the moment it is used in
some internal JetBrains projects as well. The database has been under development for more than 4 years.

Key features:
- Xodus is written in pure Java.
- Xodus is transactional and fully ACID-compliant.
- Xodus is highly concurrent.
- Xodus is schemaless and agile. No schema migrations or refactorings.
- Xodus is embedded and requires no dedicated server. No installation of it, no administration of it, no intercommunication with it.

Xodus 1.0-SNAPSHOT artifacts are available in [Maven Central](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jetbrains/xodus) repository.
