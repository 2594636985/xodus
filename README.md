##Overview
JetBrains Xodus is a transactional schema-less embedded database written in pure Java. It was initially developed for [JetBrains YouTrack](http://jetbrains.com/youtrack) (issue tracking and project management tool). At the moment Xodus is also used in some internal JetBrains projects.

Key features:
- Xodus is written in pure Java.
- Xodus is transactional and fully ACID-compliant.
- Xodus is highly concurrent. Reads are completely non-blocking due to [MVCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control) and
true [snapshot isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapshot_isolation).
- Xodus is schemaless and agile. It requires no schema migrations or refactorings.
- Xodus is embedded. It doesnâ€™t require installation and administration.

Xodus is free and licensed under [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html). Xodus 1.0-SNAPSHOT artifacts are available in [Maven Central](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/jetbrains/xodus) repository.
